<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Vinicius! 👋🤓</h2>
<p align="center">I'm a Data Scientist with some data engineering skills who is fascinated by creating end-to-end projects, explainable machine learning models and predicting human behaviour. I really love all the steps from the Data Science pipeline: collecting data, exploring, modelling, dockerizing and mantaining the model quality along the time. I believe the term full stack data scientist is a good description for what I do!</p>
