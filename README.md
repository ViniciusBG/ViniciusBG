<h2 align="center">Hello there! I'm Vinicius! 👋🤓</h2>

I'm a "Full Stack" Data Scientist who is fascinated by creating end-to-end projects (deploying), explainable machine learning models and predicting human behaviour. I really enjoy all the steps from the Data Science pipeline: collecting data, exploring, modelling, dockerizing and mantaining the model quality along the time. I believe the term full stack data scientist is a good description for what I do!

You'll probably find many unfinished work here. Unfortunately, time is being short for dealing and with end-to-end side projects, but I'm doing my best to improve it and turn this profile into a portifolio.
